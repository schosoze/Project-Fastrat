Alright, listen up: 

1. First, get Unity. This version was made in 5.6.1, so get that one.
2. Once you've got that installed, extract the "-STHG- Level Development Kit" folder to wherever.
3. Start Unity, open a project and direct it to the Root of the "-STHG- Level Development Kit" folder.
4. Once everything's loaded, open the TestStage scene if it isn't already.
5. Make a backup of the Test Stage before you start fucking with it.
6. Here's the basic controls for getting around in Unity's Scene window just in case you're too stupid to look up a tutorial:
	Right Click + WASD to move
	Right Click + EQ to go up and down
	Click on stuff to highlight it
	Hit F to zoom in on highlighted stuff
	Hit W to move highlighted stuff
	Hit E to rotate highlighted stuff
	Hit R to scale highlighted stuff
	CRTL + D to duplicate highlighted stuff
7. Don't know how to do something, or want to learn how to implement something new? Either Google it, or go to the Discord: https://discord.gg/fR2mmSn

It might take a bit to open up for the first time, but after that it should be faster.

Alright, I'm out. Bump has some other tips for you in the Test Stage, so go bother her. Make something that doesn't suck, got it? Good.
